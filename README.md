# data_structures

##### This repository contains python implementations of various fundamental abstract data structures.  These include:


##### 1.  Linked List (src/linked_list.py)

##### 2.  Stack (src/stack.py)

##### 3.  Doubly Linked List (src/dll.py)

###### The Linked List and Doubly Linked List are similar but have slightly different use cases.  The Doubly Linked List allows traversal forwards and backwards.  This could be used in an image slider or a browser's history memory, for example.  The Doubly Linked List cannot append to or shift away items from the end of the list.  The Linked List cannot move backwards or edit the end of the list.  It is, however, lighter weight than the Doubly Linked List.  

##### 4. Queue (src/queue.py)
